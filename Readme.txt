\f0\fs24 \cf0 Overview:\
Our project focuses on analyzing sentiments expressed by airline passengers through tweets. By harnessing the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, we aim to decode the sentiments into actionable insights for the aviation industry. The project utilizes PySpark, Databricks, and popular machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest to distill sentiments from a vast dataset, offering airlines a window into the passenger experience.\
\
Software and Hardware Requirements:\
Databricks Platform\
DBFS file system\
Spark (3.4.1)\
Scala (2.12)\
Contents:\
Dataset: "Tweets-2.csv" link: https://data.world/crowdflower/airline-twitter-sentiment/workspace/file?filename=Airline-Sentiment-2-w-AA.csv\
HTML document showcasing the implemented system\
Python (.ipynb) document containing the original code\
Pre-requisites:\
Access to Databricks community edition account.\
\
Instructions:\
Login to your Databricks account.\
Create a blank notebook.\
Import the Python (.ipynb) file "Airline_Sentiment_Analysis" from your local directory.\
Follow the cluster resource creation instructions in the imported notebook.\
Install necessary libraries using the provided pip commands in the "Libraries" segment.\
Run the entire document using "Run All" or run cells individually in the specified sequence.\
Note: Some models may take longer due to their complexity. Monitor run statuses accordingly.\
\
Usage:\
The project is divided into three main phases:\
\
Exploratory Data Analysis:\
\
Explore data to identify relationships between features.\
Interactive visualizations for in-depth data exploration.\
Data Cleaning and Preparation:\
\
Restructure data for modeling.\
Handle redundancy and format data suitably.\
Data splitting and sampling for model building.\
Models Building:\
\
Build predictive models using Multinomial Logistic Regression and Random Forests.\
models developed with refinements.\
Classification based on airline sentiments.\
Conclusions:\
Results from refined interaction-based models demonstrate the impact of unique feature combinations on predicting airline sentiments. The project highlights the importance of understanding feature interactions for accurate sentiment analysis.\
