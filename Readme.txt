Airline Twitter Sentiment Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sentiments expressed by airline passengers through tweets. By leveraging the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, we decode these sentiments into actionable insights for the aviation industry. The project utilizes PySpark, Databricks, and machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest to extract sentiments from a large dataset, providing airlines with insights into passenger experiences.

Software and Hardware Requirements
Databricks Platform
DBFS File System
Spark (3.4.1)
Scala (2.12)
Dataset
Dataset: Tweets-2.csv
Files included:
HTML document showcasing the implemented system
Python (.ipynb) document containing the original code
Pre-requisites
Access to a Databricks Community Edition account.
Instructions
Log in to your Databricks account.
Create a blank notebook.
Import the Python (.ipynb) file Airline_Sentiment_Analysis from your local directory.
Follow the cluster resource creation instructions provided in the imported notebook.
Install the necessary libraries using the pip commands in the "Libraries" section.
Run the entire notebook using the "Run All" option or execute individual cells in sequence.
Note: Some models may take longer to run due to their complexity. Monitor run statuses accordingly.
Usage
The project is divided into three main phases:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
Analyze the data to identify relationships between features.
Create interactive visualizations for in-depth data exploration.
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Restructure data for modeling.
Handle redundancy and format the data appropriately.
Split and sample the data for model building.
3. Model Building
Build predictive models using Multinomial Logistic Regression and Random Forests.
Refine models to enhance accuracy.
Classify airline sentiments based on the trained models.
Conclusions
Results from the refined interaction-based models show the impact of combining unique feature sets on predicting airline sentiments. This project underscores the importance of understanding feature interactions for accurate sentiment analysis.
